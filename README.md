# Igi kanam

Character creation website based on the DSA system, but not limited to the official rules and abilities.\
Inspired by the [Optolith app](https://optolith.app/en), Igikanam aims to provide similiar functionality with more freedom to customize the available options, and as a website as opposed to installable app.

## Goals

- Multiple characters available wherever you log in.
- Ability to add custom races, cultures, professions, skills, special abilities and spells.
- Ability to modify characteristics of the given ability etc like AP cost and requirements.
- Share your characters with your Game Master (High Lord according to the rules) and other players.

## Name origin

With the help of a friend who knows Summerian, we have come up with a Summerian name that roughly translates to "The Dark Eye".\
Igi means "eye", and kanam roughly means "dark". You can learn more on [ePSD](http://psd.museum.upenn.edu/nepsd-frame.html).\
The alternate name closer to the german origin (Das Schwarze Auge - the black eye) would be Igi gi6, which doesn't nearly sound as cool.

## How to run/use

To be determined, the project is still in early stages of development
